# Fun-coding-projects
 A collection of coding projects I have done mostly during my high school

[Still finding, organizing and uploading small projects that I have done way before. So stay in touch!]

## Fun and learning
I did most of these projects for learning and fun. I have learned a lot in computer science, math and physics by creating and doing these projects. I love learn as I go and tackle my problems along the way. It feels so satisfying when I figure out something that is blocking my way of learning and doing the projects.

## How to run
- P5 JS projects: projects developed using P5JS framework
  - run the Server.bat file **OR** start a local server in the directory containing index.html 
- Other projects: run with according executable or IDE
